## Achievement 7 - Set up a Global Gitignore

### Author: Kaleb Berhane
### Reflection Questions 
  1. The documentation instructions were not easier to understand, i found them not instructive enough and so at times it was hard to understand what the code was doing. The in class walkthrough's and having an instructor was what really helped me understand git and commandline.
  2. I do not know to revere like git commit and push, (i don't think reverse in git add is neccessary).
